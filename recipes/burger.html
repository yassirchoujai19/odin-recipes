    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A burger, short for "hamburger," is a popular type of sandwich that consists of a cooked ground meat patty, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bun or roll. The patty is typically seasoned, cooked, and then placed between the two halves of the bun. Burgers are often served with various toppings and condiments, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, pickles, and more, depending on personal preferences.
      Burgers are a staple of many fast-food and casual dining establishments around the world and have become a widely recognized and enjoyed food item. They come in a variety of styles and sizes, including cheeseburgers (with melted cheese on top of the patty), veggie burgers (made from plant-based ingredients), and specialty burgers with unique toppings and flavor combinations.</p>
