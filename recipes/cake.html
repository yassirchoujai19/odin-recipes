    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chocolate cake is a delicious dessert that features chocolate as its main flavor component. It's made by combining ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, cocoa powder, and butter or oil to create a rich and moist cake batter. The batter is then typically baked in round cake pans and allowed to cool before being decorated or frosted.
      The result is a decadent and indulgent cake with a deep chocolate flavor. The texture can vary from dense and fudgy to light and airy, depending on the recipe and baking techniques used. Chocolate cakes are often enjoyed on their own or paired with various frostings or fillings that complement the chocolate flavor. Common options include chocolate ganache, buttercream frosting, cream cheese frosting, or even layers of chocolate mousse.
      Chocolate cakes can be decorated in numerous ways, from a simple dusting of powdered sugar to elaborate designs using piping techniques, edible decorations, and more. They are popular for birthdays, celebrations, and as a comforting treat for chocolate lovers.</p>
